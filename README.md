# Road-Warrior-Revamped-
A project dedicated to the revitalization and revamping of the famous mobile game: Road Warrior

The main objective of this project is to fix and update the source code of the mobile game Road Warrior so it can work in the present (and future) versions of Unity and
mobile devices.

Road Warrior was a popular mobile game developed by Mobjoy (now a defunct company) that was released on iOS and Android platforms in 2012. The game was a 
post-apocalyptic racing game that allowed players to build their vehicles and race against bots and bosses in a single player environment, and other players in a 
multiplayer environment. As many who are familiar with the game, Road Warrior was removed from the app stores somewhere in 2015 due to the company, Mobjoy going defunct.

The intentions and goals of the project are:
1) Properly reverse engineer the game, so we can fix and update the source code of the game

2) Release it here on github for people to play, and if allowed, re-release it on the app store for people to play again.

3) Add some new content to freshen up the game while staying true to the game's atmosphere and environment.

Intentions that are not part of the project are:
1) Making money off the game

2) Violating any copyright issues. 

I do not want to steal any content from their rightful creators. I also do not want to make money off this. I simply want to revive this legendary game.

Questions, concerns, or you want to join the project, join up on the Discord server (Server is currently WIP).
